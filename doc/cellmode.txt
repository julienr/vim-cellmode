=============================================================================
1. Introduction                          *CellmodeIntro*

This a vim plugin that enables MATLAB-style cell mode execution for python
scripts in vim, assuming an ipython interpreter running in screen (or tmux).

Blocks are delimited by ##. For example, say you have the following python
script :
>
  ##
  import numpy as np
  print 'Hello'                  # (1)
  np.zeros(3)
  ##
  if True:
    print 'Yay !'                # (2)
    print 'Foo'                  # (3)
  ##
<
If you put your cursor on the line marked with (1) and hit Ctrl-G, the 3
lines in the first cell will be sent to tmux. If you hit Ctrl-B, the same
will happen but the cursor will move to the line after the ## (so you can
chain Ctrl-B).

You can also select line(s) and hit Ctrl-C to send them to tmux. The
plugin automatically deindent selected lines so that the first line has no
indentation. So for example if you select the line marked (2) and (3), the
print statements will be de-indented and sent to tmux and ipython will
correctly run them.

2. Usage                                       *CellmodeUsage*

This plugin assumes you have an ipython interpreter running in tmux.
The target tmux pane to which python cells will be sent should be
'ipython:ipython.0'

This means you have to run the following in tmux :
>
  rename-session ipython
  rename-window ipython
<
Then,you can use the |cellmode-mappings| to execute cells and send them to
your ipython interpreter.

=============================================================================
3. Mappings                                       *CellmodeMappings*

By default, the following mappings are enabled :

  C-c sends the currently selected lines to tmux
  C-g sends the current cell to tmux
  C-b sends the current cell to tmux, moving to the next one

In addition, there is a function to execute all cells above the current line
which isn't bound by default, but you can easily bind it with :

  noremap <silent> <C-a> :call RunTmuxPythonAllCellsAbove()<CR>

=============================================================================
4. Options                                       *CellmodeOptions*

To configure the target tmux pane in which ipython is running, use the
three following variables (which can be either globals or buffer-local (b:)) :

  let g:cellmode_tmux_sessionname='ipython'
  let g:cellmode_tmux_windowname='ipython'
  let g:cellmode_tmux_panenumber='0'

You can also set `g:cellmode_tmux_sessionname` and `g:cellmode_tmux_windowname` to empty
strings. This will make tmux automatically pick a tmux session. If you are
running vim inside tmux, this will pick the current tmux session. Otherwise,
it seems to pick the most recently launched session.

You can change the default mappings which are defined by

  vmap <silent> <C-c> :call RunTmuxPythonChunk()<CR>
  noremap <silent> <C-b> :call RunTmuxPythonCell(0)<CR>
  noremap <silent> <C-g> :call RunTmuxPythonCell(1)<CR>
